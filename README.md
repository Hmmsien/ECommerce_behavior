# ECommerce_behavior

## :notebook: Description 

Data Science visualization project using ecommerce data. Analyze data which is about e-commerce customer behavior. \
Using this data, create a customer view vs. company view.   
- For the customer side, they will be able to see their search history, recommendations, and still adding to it. 
- For the company side, they will be able to see which product is being sold the most, which company has the highest selling rate, which company has the highest view rate, and which product is trending the most. The most interesting part of the project is comparing what people view vs. what people buy. \
If we are able to, we will try to create suggestions based on what the users add to their cart.

### Visualization
- Two graphs on the side what people view vs. what people buy
- which product is being sold the most
- which company has the highest selling rate
- which company has the highest view rate
- same thing with the product: which product is trending the most


### Predicting
- Recommended bundles of products/Suggest Products based on what is on the cart.
